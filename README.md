# JupyterLite with api proxy

This project is a jupyterlite distro designed to be used with an api proxy for convenient session setup and cached querying of third party APIs. See [fastapi-jupyterlite](https://github.com/wagov/fastapi-jupyterlite) for the supporting API server that allows for querying apis cross domain with additional security.
